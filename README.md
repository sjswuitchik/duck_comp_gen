Genome assembly and comparative genomics project with the freckled duck (Stictonetta naevosa; stiNae), ruddy duck (Oxyura jamaicensis; oxyJam), African pygmy-goose (Nettapus auritus; netAur), and black-headed duck (Heteronetta atricapilla; hetAtr) from 10x data using Supernova assembly.

Code is being organized and optimized. The current directory structure is as follows: 

`01_assemblies`: Genome assemblies and initial quality checks from Supernova assembly of 10X data  
`02_wga`:
