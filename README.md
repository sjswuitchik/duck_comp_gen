Genome assembly and comparative genomics project with the freckled duck (Stictonetta naevosa; stiNae), ruddy duck (Oxyura jamaicensis; oxyJam), African pygmy-goose (Nettapus auritus; netAur), and black-headed duck (Heteronetta atricapilla; hetAtr) from 10x data using Supernova assembly.

Code is being written and optimized, so will change frequently as analyses progress.
