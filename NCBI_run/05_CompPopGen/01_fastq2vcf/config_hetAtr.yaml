minNmer: 500                    # the minimum Nmer used to split up the genome; e.g. a value of 200 means only Nmers 200 or greater are used to define the boundaries of intervals. The minimum is 50.
maxIntervalLen: 15000000          # the desired maximum size of an interval for calling variants; more than 2Mb is a good starting point
maxBpPerList: 15000000            # the desired maximum number of bp per list file for GATK4; list files potentially contain many small intervals, and we cap the fraction of the genome contained in each list file here
maxIntervalsPerList: 200        # the desired maximum number of intervals per list file for GATK4; this prevents list files from containing thousands of small intervals, which can slow parts of GATK4. Default is good.

maxDP_fb: 200 # this is the maximum depth parameter used for freebayes, site with more than this number are ignored, change according to expected depth
