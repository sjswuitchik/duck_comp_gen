## Analyses of conserved non-coding elements  
  
This directory contains:  
* `01_setup` directory, which contains the scripts necessary for assemblng & aligning the CNEEs, as well as creating the 4-fold degenerate neutral site models  
* `02_phyloAcc` directory, which contains the scripts required to prepare the data for input to PhyloAcc (https://phyloacc.github.io/) and to run PhyloAcc across three possible topolgies of the phylogenetic polytomy  
    * this directory also contains the `control` and `allDucks` directories, which are PhyloAcc runs with differing target species (explained in detail in `02_phyloAcc/README.md`)
* `03_analyses` directory, which contains the scripts to process the PhyloAcc outputs, and conduct i) genome-wide spatial enrichment analysis, ii) spatial gene enrichment analyses, and iii) permutation-based GO enrichment analyses  
* `outputs` directory, which contains the files generated by the scripts in the subdirectories, whether they are necessary inputs for subsequent analyses or end results  
  
  
Data related to the CNEE analyses are archived in `/n/holylfs05/LABS/informatics/Users/swuitchik/ducks/02_ncbi_analyses/03_cnees`
