## Phylogenetic polytomy resolution using CNEEs & protein-coding sequences  
  
This directory contains:  
* script `01_createFASTAs.sh`, which contains the code for generating one FASTA per CNEE
* script `02_align_raxml.sh`, which contains the code for aligning the CNEEs with MUSCLE and running RAXML-NG
* script `03_astral.sh`, which contains the code for generating the consensus tree
* script `04_proteinCoding_orthos.sh`, which contains the code for the same analyses but with protein-coding sequences
  
  
The data associated with these analyses are archived in `insert path here`
